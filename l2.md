# Part 1

This is the code for StringServer:

Here are examples of its usage:

![Image](l3s3.png)

In both examples, a method that gets called is `handleRequest`. It takes the URL as an argument. The values passed are as follows:

First example -- localhost:9090/add-message?s=Welcome.
Second example -- localhost:9090/add-message?s=to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment center.

`getPath()` is also called. In both instances, it returns `/add-message`.

There is a field called strr that is the string that gets displayed on the webpage. In the first example, "Welcome." is added to the string in a new line. In the next example, "to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment center." is once again added as a new line.

# Part 2

The "reversed" method is bugged when inputting almost any value, for instance, `{1, 2}` returns something with the value of 0 index 0:

```
@Test
  public void testReversed2() {
    int[] input1 = {1, 2};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{2, 1}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
  ```
