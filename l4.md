4a. vim TestExamples.java

4b. /index1 +=;

4c. `<enter>`
  
4d. n (x2)

4e. 6
  
4f. `<right arrow>`
  
4g. I
  
4h. `<backspace>`
  
4i. 2
  
4j. `<esc>`
  
4k. :wq

To get to the problematic line, we use `/` to find instances of "index 1 +=;" It is down two from the start, so n is pressed twice. 6 plus the right arrow moves the cursor to the number that needs to be changed. Insert mode is entered, and it is modified to the correct value. Normal mode is entered once again and the file is saved and closed.

5.\ bash test.sh

The tests are run again, and this time they pass.
