# Step 4 - Log into ieng6

`ssh cs15lsp23as@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

`[my password]`

`<enter>`

This logs into the server where everything will be done. I had to enter my password because I am using a different computer than the one I added the ssh key to.

# Step 5 - Clone Fork

`git clone git@github.com:kisenera/lab7.git`

`<enter>`

`cd lab7`

`<enter>`

This clones my fork of the Lab 7 repository, and then it is `cd`'d into, making it the current working directory.

# Step 6 - Run Tests

`bash test.sh`

`<enter>`

The test script runs, showing that the code has errors.

# Edit the Code to Fix

`vim ListExamples.java`

`<enter>`

`/index1 +=`

`<enter>`
  
`n` (x2)

`6`
  
`<right arrow>`
  
`I`
  
`<backspace>`
  
`2`
  
`<esc>`
  
`:wq`

`<enter>`

First, the problematic file is opened in Vim. To get to the bugged line, we use `/` to find instances of "index 1 +=;" It is down two from the start, so `n` is pressed twice. `6` plus the `right arrow` moves the cursor to the number that needs to be changed. Insert mode is entered with `I`, and the wrong value is corrected. Normal mode is entered once again with `<esc>` and the file is saved and closed with `:wq`.

 # Step 7 - Run the Tests After Bugfix
 
`bash test.sh`

`<enter>`

The tests are run again, and this time they pass.

# Step 9 - Commit and Push the Change

`git commit ListExamples.java`

`<enter>`
  
`I`
  
`fix`

`<esc>`
  
`:wq`

`<enter>`

The changes to the file are committed to the repository. Insert mode is entered to write 'fix' as the commit message, which is then saved and closed. `git add` is not needed because only one file is being pushed; `git commit <file>` works fine.

`git push`

`<enter>`

Finally, the changes are pushed.
