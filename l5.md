What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?
**I am using Windows 10 with Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL), and Sublime Text.**


Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.
**I have a bash script that runs a java script repeatedly (number specified by user). It is supposed to create a new unique text file for each output, however, it only makes one for the last run.**



Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.
