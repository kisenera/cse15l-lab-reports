It is printing all lines that do not contain the string 'a'. This could be useful in a file that has an abundance of a specific character, and lines that omit it are significant in some way. Maybe a list of files, and you want to see which files are there that do not belong to a specific directory (the string you would grep with)

`grep -v ' ' government/Alcohol_Problems/Session4-PDF.txt`

Here, it is printing all lines without a space. This translates to empty lines and last words in paragraphs.
## -n
Print the number of each matching line, as well as the lines themselves.
`grep -n legal government/Media/A_Perk_Of_Age.txt`
Output:

This prints the corresponding line number of each line that has a matching phrase. This could be useful in programming contexts, where specific parts of code are referenced with line numbers.

`grep -n Karima government/Media/Working_for_Free.txt`
Output:
```

Line 10 alone is printed because it is the only one with the author's name.
## -r
Recursively search through a directory, rather than a single file

```
Every line in every file in the biomed directory is searched for 'ion channels', and the corresponding file that each listing was found in is printed as well. This is very useful if you want to search through multiple text files easily.

`grep -r lovely .`
Output:
```./plos/journal.pbio.0020064.txt:        School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States) says that â€˜it is lovely to see
```
Here, the entire techincal folder (current working directory) is searched for 'lovely'
## -c
Print only the count of lines with occurences, rather than the lines themselves.
`grep -c 'circuit' biomed/gb-2001-2-4-research0012.txt`
Output:
```
8
```
The number of lines that have the word 'circuit' in them are printed. This is useful if you just want to know how many lines of a file contain a string, and don't need to know the specific lines themselves.

`grep -c 'we' government/Post_Rate_Comm/Gleiman_EMASpeech.txt`
Output:
```
44
```
44, the number of lines in the file that contain the phrase 'we', is printed.
